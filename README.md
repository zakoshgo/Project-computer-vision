The pipeline is shown in the jupyter notebook "Rover_Project_Test_Notebook.ipynb" within the code file
the notebook uses a random output image from the simulator and put it through the pipeline to show the
diffrent stages of the image proccessing.

when the simulator starts a realtime debugging mode is enabled to show the diffrent stages of the realtime
input image through the simulator run.

Use this link to download the simulator:
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Rover+Unity+Sims/Linux_Roversim.zip

To run the code a few steps must taken.
1)Set up enviroment; make sure following libraries must be included within your enviroment:
	-cv2
	-numpy
	-matplotlib
	-scipy
	-glob
	-imageio
	-time
	-PIL
	-io
	-base64

2)using the terminal activate the enviroment you will use only if it is any other library than the root enviorment
  using the command: conda ativate EnviromentName.

3)using the terminal from within the code file directory use the command: python drive_rover.py
  the initiates a server with code running within

4)launch the Roversim in autonmous mode and the rover will start exploring on its own.
